# Student API

This is a RESTful API for managing student data. It allows you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a student database.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- MongoDB

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-api.git

2. Install the dependencies:

cd student-api
npm install

3. Configure the MongoDB connection:
Edit the server.js file and replace the MongoDB connection URL with your own database URL.

4. Start the server:
node server.js
The server will start running at http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

GET /students: Fetch all students
GET /students/:id: Fetch a single student by ID
POST /students: Add a new student
PUT /students/:id: Update a student by ID
DELETE /students/:id: Delete a student by ID
Usage
You can test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or by making HTTP requests from your application. Here's an example using cURL:

# Fetch all students
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/students

# Fetch a single student
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/students/:id

# Add a new student
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 20, "major": "Computer Science"}' http://localhost:3000/students

# Update a student
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Jane Doe", "age": 21, "major": "Mathematics"}' http://localhost:3000/students/:id

# Delete a student
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/students/:id
